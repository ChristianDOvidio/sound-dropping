## Testing Local Changes

To test changes to the sound-dropping game locally:

1. Make your changes to the code in the `sound-dropping-game` directory.
2. Rebuild the game by running `npx rollup -c` in the `npx serve` directory. This will update the `bundle.js` file.
3. Open `sound-dropping-game/index.html` in a web browser to test your changes.
